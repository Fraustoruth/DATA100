# DATA100
PROJECT 1: Food Safety
Cleaning and Exploring Data with Pandas
Due Date: Sunday 07/05, 11:59 PM
Collaboration Policy
Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the project, we ask that you write your solutions individually. If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook.

This Assignment
In this project, we will investigate restaurant food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco. The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to walk through the process of Data Cleaning and EDA.

As we clean and explore these data, you will gain practice with:

Reading simple csv files and using Pandas
Working with data at different levels of granularity
Identifying the type of data collected, missing values, anomalies, etc.
Exploring characteristics and distributions of individual variables

PROJECT 2: Spam/Ham Classification
Feature Engineering, Logistic Regression, Cross Validation

This Assignment
In this project, you will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.

After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:

Feature engineering with text data
Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models
Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting
Generating and analyzing precision-recall curves
