    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",

    "- **Unsatisfactory** (0 points): No chart is created, or a chart with completely wrong results.\n",

    "Please note that you will only receive support in OH and Piazza for Matplotlib and seaborn questions. However, you may use some other Python libraries to help you create you visualizations.
